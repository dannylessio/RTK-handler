# RTK-handler
Given a .csv file containing the informations about the projections (projections angles, proj_offset_x/y, Io source intensity) and an MHA raw projection stack, RTK-handler helps with the creation of the RTK .xml geometry, with the normalization of the MHA stack and with the reconstruction using the rtkfdk procedure.
